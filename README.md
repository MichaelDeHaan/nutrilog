## Description

<blockquote>
Nutrilog: Smart Nutrition is a smart food-tracking app. It lets users see details about the foods and recipes they consume, emphasizing nutritional education and guidance. 
Nutrilog is a Web App that can be accessed with any modern web browser. The main objective of this app is to inform users of the nutritional value of the foods they eat, 
promoting overall better health outcomes. Additionally, Nutrilog can help identify recipe ingredients that may be harmful to users with special dietary needs 
and suggest appropriate alternatives. For example, a user says they are allergic to milk and eggs. The app will recommend bread recipes that have no eggs or milk.
Users can search for and log food items and recipes using custom filters and flags. Specialists can offer personally tailored assistance to users who require it. Lastly, 
an Admin has full access to the system and can perform operations on User and Specialist metadata to gain insights based on the app's analytics.
