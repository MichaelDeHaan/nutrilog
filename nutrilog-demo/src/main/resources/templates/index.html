                the nutritional values of the foods that you consume, leading to overall better health outcomes.
                In addition, Nutrilog can provide information about the ingredients that are in foods that 
                are common allergens such as eggs, peanuts, shellfish, etc. so that users with allergies know what foods 
                to avoid. But it doesn't just provide allergen information, it also recommends allergen free alternatives!

                plans made specifically for individual users.
